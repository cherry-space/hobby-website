            Durian is a tropical fruit known for its <b>strong smell</b>.
            <br>However, it is often referred to as the <b>"king of fruits"</b> because of its taste.
            <br>As a person who loves trying new foods, I had to try it!
            <br>It was definitely an interesting experience and I really liked its taste. 
            <br>While it smells terrible, I found that the taste was quite unique and delicious.
            <br>It is a must-try for those who are curious!
            <br>Frankly speaking, my mom and dad did not like it at all, lol.
